    <h2>Who I am</h2>

    <p>I’m Anna Nogarè, a Creative Director & Strategist working on large-scale international projects across culture, education, tourism, and technology.</p>
    <p>With over ten years of international experience, I create complex digital, physical, and hybrid experiences and ecosystems. My work brings together creative direction, experience strategy, and cross-functional coordination, supporting teams and stakeholders in shaping projects that integrate vision, research, and organizational goals into coherent, meaningful, and accessible outcomes.</p>
    <p>I’m CPACC-certified (Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies) by the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP), and an active member of the association.</p>
    <p>Some of the organizations I’ve worked with include the National Museum of Qatar (Doha, QA), ilmi Science Discovery & Innovation Center (Riyadh, SA), the Museum of Natural Sciences (Brussels, BE), the Icelandic Museum of Natural History (Reykjavík, IS), Het Steen Visitor Center (Antwerp, BE), Canon Professional Network (Europe), the Dutch National Police (NL), Amnesty International Nederlands (NL), and others across different sectors.</p>

    <h2>How I work</h2>

    <p>In my work, I’ve learned that engagement starts by meeting people where they are. Everyone understands, learns, and expresses themselves differently: through images, stories, sound, movement, or interaction. What matters is creating spaces where people can feel something, connect, reflect, and take something with them.</p>
    <p>When information is emotionally resonant and easy to navigate, it opens doors. By embedding play, informal learning, and curiosity into the experience, moments become more meaningful and memorable. When learning doesn’t feel forced or formal, it becomes more human, grounded in exploration, empathy, and discovery.</p>
    <p>We need flexible and welcoming journeys that respond to diverse needs and ways of being. It means creating multi-sensory experiences where people can reach the same destination in different ways, at their own pace, in their own style. The most powerful experiences aren’t just seen; they’re felt, lived, and remembered.</p>
    <p>In practice, I start by understanding who an experience is for, what kind of emotional or learning response it should create, and how people might move through a space, system, or piece of content. I use research, testing, and observation to shape a clear direction, then develop structures that balance ambition with feasibility, budget, and long-term impact, bringing ideas to life through co-creation, prototyping, and iteration in a way that supports inclusion, sustainability, and long-term growth.</p>

    <h2>Who I am</h2>

    <p>I’m Anna Nogaré, a Creative Director & Accessibility Strategist specialized in creating learning experiences that everyone can enjoy.</p>
    <p>With international experience across cultural, educational, and public sector institutions, I develop interpretive solutions and immersive environments designed to create emotional connection and meaningful storytelling.</p>
    <p>I’m certified in CPACC (Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies) by the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP) and a member of the organization.</p>
    <p>Some of the clients I’ve worked with are: <br />The National Museum of Qatar (Doha, QA), The ilmi Science Discovery & Innovation Center (Riyadh, SA), Museum of Natural Sciences (Brussels, BE), The Icelandic Museum of Natural History (Reykjavík, IS), The Rijksmuseum Boerhaave (Leiden, NL) and many more.</p>

    <h2>How I work</h2>

    <p>After years of designing experiences, I’ve learned that engagement means meeting people where they are and recognising that everyone learns and expresses themselves differently: through images, stories, sound, movement, or interaction. What matters is creating spaces where people feel something, and where they can connect, reflect, and take something with them.</p>
    <p>When information is emotionally resonant and easy to navigate, it opens doors. By embedding play, informal learning, and curiosity, we make those moments more meaningful and impactful. When learning doesn’t feel forced or formal, it becomes more human, grounded in exploration, empathy, and discovery.</p>
    <p>We need flexible and welcoming journeys that respond to diverse needs and ways of being. It means creating multi-sensory experiences where people can reach the same destination in different ways, at their own pace, in their own style. The most powerful experiences aren’t just seen; they’re felt, lived, and remembered.</p>
    <p>In my work, I begin by understanding who the experience is for, what kind of emotional or learning response we want to create, and how people might move through a space or piece of content. I then develop a flexible narrative and structure, grounded in strategic thinking around feasibility, budget, and long-term impact. I bring concepts to life through co-creation, prototyping, and iteration in ways that feel intuitive, inclusive, and meaningful while supporting the project’s sustainability and future growth.</p>

    <h2>What I offer</h2>

    <p>I work with museums, cultural institutions, and public organizations to make knowledge more accessible, engaging, and emotionally meaningful, both in physical spaces and across digital platforms.</p>
    <p>Here’s how I can support your project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strategy</strong> <br />I define goals, understand audiences, and build solid structures that align vision with reality, helping projects grow, adapt, and stay meaningful.</li>
      <li><strong>Creative direction</strong> <br />I shape concepts for exhibitions, learning experiences, and educational tools. I guide the creative process from the first idea to final delivery, with a focus on curiosity and play.</li>
      <li><strong>Art direction</strong> <br />I translate complex information into layered narratives, guiding the visitor journey through a clear visual language based on a flexible and inclusive approach to content.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility consulting (CPACC certified)</strong> <br />I guide compliance with WCAG, EAA, and inclusive design standards from the beginning. I review with real users in mind and offer talks and workshops to help teams adopt accessibility as a shared mindset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every project is different, and so is every team. But I always bring the same things: direction, passion, and a people-focused mindset.</p>

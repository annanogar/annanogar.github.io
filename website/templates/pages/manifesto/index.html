    <p>Accessibility isn’t a favor. It’s not about being benevolent.<br />And it’s definitely not just for a few.</p>
    <p><strong>It’s about ability—and that changes all the time.</strong></p>
    <p>Break an arm? Lose your glasses? Struggling with a new language? Suddenly, the world isn’t built for you. Blinded by the sun? Exhausted? Having a killer headache? Suddenly, even the simplest tasks feel impossible.</p>
    <p>Let’s face it: the chances of you staying fully able-bodied your entire life are extremely low, if not nonexistent. That’s why it makes more sense to think of everyone as temporarily able-bodied.</p>
    <p><strong>Accessibility isn’t special treatment.</strong></p>
    <p>It’s just making things better for everyone because we all benefit from subtitles, automatic doors, and easy-to-read instructions. As simple as that.</p>
    <p><strong>So, why do we still treat accessibility like a bureaucratic checklist to verify at the end of the project?</strong></p>
    <p>I’m done watching that happen. I want to create experiences where everyone feels welcome, capable, and comfortable.</p>

    <p>I want to make things less frustrating for everyone.</p>
    <p>There’s still a lot of stigma around human diversity, and many of us still fall into rigid ways of thinking, but I’m glad to see that inclusivity is getting more and more attention.</p>
    <p><strong>The revolution is happening, and I want to be part of it!</strong></p>
    <p>Not just in my work but by changing the way we think about accessibility: it shouldn’t be an afterthought but a mindset.</p>

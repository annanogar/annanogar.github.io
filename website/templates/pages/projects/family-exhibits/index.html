Within this journey, the museum created Family Exhibits for children aged 5 to 15, designed to make Qatar’s heritage engaging and accessible.</p><p>My work focused on three of these exhibits, <em>Archaeology, Life on the Coast, and Energy,</em> where visitors can dig up ancient artifacts, discover traditional pearl diving culture, and learn about the vital role energy resources play in the country’s story. Each gallery combines interactive games, hands-on activities, and immersive projections to bring Qatari history, traditions, and culture to life.</p>',

My role covered design systems and user experience strategy, ensuring cohesion across multiple interactive modules, immersive projections, and physical-digital integrations. The process involved extensive prototyping, user flow definition, and iterative testing to balance accessibility, engagement, and educational value under demanding delivery constraints. By applying game mechanics and informal learning principles, the exhibits invited families to explore, experiment, and connect through play across diverse formats.</p><p>Leading both my internal team and external partners, I was responsible for maintaining quality, impact, and timely delivery under pressure, embedding design thinking and collaboration throughout the process.</p>',

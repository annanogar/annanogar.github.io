// Main stylesheet entrypoint

// NOTE: base.scss contains @use and @include declarations.
// component.scss can also contain both. The order matters.
//
// Since sass v1.77? @use can only come before @include,
// but we can't use @use for everything,
// so by splitting it up and combining it back here,
// we have full control over the order of imports back.
// Just <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css"> in the HTML.
//
// If we want to load them seperately, we can do that too.
// Like when we want to shove a theme file with variables in between. :)
// Just <link rel="stylesheet" href="base.css"> and -"component.css"> in the HTML.

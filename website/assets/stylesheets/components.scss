// Components

// We used to use @imports for these, with side effects.
// We can use @use, but this means we cannot put them below the base declarations.
// This is because @use must come before any other CSS rules.
// It is not useful to use @forward in this case.
// Since these are imported with side effects, this means the order is the wrong way 'round.
// Thus, we have to use a second stylesheet entry point.

@use '../../components/atoms/*/*' as atoms;
@use '../../components/molecules/*/*' as molecules;
@use '../../components/organisms/*/*' as organisms;
@use '../../components/structures/*/*' as structures;

// Plugins (@import === @use as *)
//@use 'swiper/swiper' as *;
